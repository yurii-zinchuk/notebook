# Notebook

This is the studying project and an implementation of a Notebook porgram with terminal interface. The application is written in the [studying materials](https://library.kre.dp.ua/Books/2-4%20kurs/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8F%20%2B%20%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8F/Python/Python_3_Object_Oriented_Programming.pdf).

## Usage

To start using the program just run the module 'menu.py' in the terminal:

```bash
menu.py
```

And after that follow the instructions. You can add, and modify notes in your notebook. Also, you can search them by keywords and see their information.

However, once you stop running the program, all the notes will be lost.
